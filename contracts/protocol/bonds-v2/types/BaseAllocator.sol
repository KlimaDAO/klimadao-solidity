/**
 * @title BaseAllocator
 * @notice
 *  This abstract contract serves as a template for writing new Klima Allocators.
 *  Many of the functionalities regarding handling of Treasury funds by the Guardian have
 *  been delegated to the `TreasuryExtender` contract, and thus an explanation for them can be found
 *  in `TreasuryExtender.sol`.
 *
 *  The main purpose of this abstract contract and the `IAllocator` interface is to provide
 *  a unified framework for how an Allocator should behave. Below an explanation of how
 *  we expect an Allocator to behave in general, mentioning the most important points.
 *
 *  Activation:
 *   - An Allocator is first deployed with all necessary arguments.
 *     Thereafter, each deposit is registered with the `TreasuryExtender`.
 *     This assigns a unique id for each deposit (set of allocations) in an Allocator.
 *   - Next, the Allocators allocation and loss limits are set via the extender function.
 *   - Finally, the Allocator is activated by calling `activate`.
 *
 *  Runtime:
 *   The Allocator is in communication with the Extender, it must inform the Extender
 *   what the status of the tokens is which were allocated. We only care about noting down
 *   their status in the Extender. A quick summary of the important functions on this topic:
 *
 *   - `update(uint256 id)` is the main function that deals with state reporting, where
 *     `_update(uint256 id)` is the internal function to implement, which should update Allocator
 *     internal state. `update(uint256 id)` then continues to report the Allocators state via `report`
 *     to the extender. `_update(uint256 id)` should handle _investment_ of funds present in Contract.
 *
 *   - `deallocate` should handle allocated token withdrawal, preparing the tokens to be withdrawn
 *     by the Extender. It is not necessary to handle approvals for this token, because it is automatically
 *     approved in the constructor. For other token withdrawals, it is assumed that reward tokens will
 *     either be sold into underlying (allocated) or that they will simply rest in the Contract, being reward tokens.
 *     Please also check function documentation.
 *
 *   - `rewardTokens` and `utilityTokens` should return the above mentioned simple reward tokens for the former case,
 *     while utility tokens should be those tokens which are continously reinvested or otherwise used by the contract
 *     in order to accrue more rewards. A reward token can also be a utility token, but then one must prepare them
 *     separately for withdrawal if they are to be returned to the treasury.
 *
 *  Migration & Deactivation:
 *   - `prepareMigration()` together with the virtual `_prepareMigration()` sets the state of the Allocator into
 *     MIGRATING, disabling further token deposits, enabling only withdrawals, and preparing all funds for withdrawal.
 *
 *   - `migrate` then executes the migration and also deactivates the Allocator.
 *
 *   - `deactivate` sets `status` to OFFLINE, meaning it simply deactivates the Allocator. It can be passed
 *     a panic boolean, meaning it handles deactivation logic in `deactivate`. The Allocator panic deactivates if
 *     this state if the loss limit is reached via `update`. The Allocator can otherwise also simply be deactivated
 *     and funds transferred back to the Treasury.
 *
 *  This was a short summary of the Allocator lifecycle.

     *
     *  End state should be that allocator amounts have been swapped for allocators, that gain + loss is netted out 0
     *  for original allocator, and that the new allocators gain has been set to the original allocators gain.
     *  We don't transfer the loss because we have the information how much was initially invested + gain,
